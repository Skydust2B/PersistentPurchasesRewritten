# Persistent Purchases Rewritten
A Lethal Company mod that makes bought suits and furnitures stay behind after getting ejected into space

Based on the rewrite branch of PersistentPurchases from NotSoEpic: https://github.com/NotSoEpic/PeristentPurchases/tree/rewrite

Configurable to keep any of suits and furnitures.

This is the first mod I ever did or modified. So issues are expected but I'll do my best to deal with them.
I tried to not patch any original methods from the game to ensure better stability.
